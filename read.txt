 so how this chat application is going to work as of now 

 1. The user will login with his emmail and password 
 
 2. when the user is logged in he can make different chat room by seleting the number of users in it  

 3. when the room is slected it is displayed on the top of message bar user can also see number of users in that chat room 

 4. After this we have implemnted the socket.io library for real time chat 

 




 // offcourse i will make a change in this what i will do there will a common chat section and then there will be a private chat section where you  can send message privatly to any of the user
