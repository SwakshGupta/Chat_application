 so how this chat application is going to work as of now 

 1. The user will login with his emmail and password 
 
 2. For each user we will have different chat rooms which will have different users now our user can select a perticular chat room 

 3. after selecting a perticular chat room  number of user in that chat room will render on the screen with their conversation as well

 4. Inside the chat room the user become the sender and reciever  when he send the message then that message will be visible to all the user 

 




 // offcourse i will make a change in this what i will do there will a common chat section and then there will be a private chat section where you  can send message privatly to any of the user
